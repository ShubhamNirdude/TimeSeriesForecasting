# Project: Time Series Forecasting of Monthly Gold Prices

## Objective: 
Developed a predictive model to forecast monthly gold prices using time series analysis techniques.
## Data: 
Utilized a dataset with 12,330 rows, encompassing integer, float, string, and boolean data types, with no missing values.
## Tools and Technologies:
## Libraries: 
NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Statsmodels, Scikit-learn, Warnings
## Techniques: 
Linear regression, time series analysis, feature selection, log transformations, aggregation of categorical variables
## Key Actions:
i)   Conducted extensive data cleaning and preprocessing to ensure data integrity.
ii)  Applied value counting to verify categorical observations.
iii) Analyzed and retained 125 duplicate entries, considering them part of the user visit session patterns.
iv)  Identified and removed redundant features to optimize the model.
v)   Used various statistical and machine learning methods to build an accurate forecasting model.
## Outcome: Achieved reliable forecasts of gold prices, enabling better decision-making for stakeholders.
